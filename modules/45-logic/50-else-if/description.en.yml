name: else if
theory: |

  The `getTypeOfSentence` function from the previous lesson only distinguishes interrogative and regular sentences. Let's try adding support for exclamation sentences:

  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    getTypeOfSentence("Who?");  // => 'Sentence is question'
    getTypeOfSentence("No'");   // => 'Sentence is normal'
    getTypeOfSentence("No!");   // => 'Sentence is exclamation'
  }

  static String getTypeOfSentence(String sentence) {
    var lastChar = sentence.charAt(sentence.length() - 1);
    var sentenceType = "";
    if (lastChar == '?') {
      sentenceType = "question";
    }

    if (lastChar == '!') {
      sentenceType = "exclamation";
    } else {
      sentenceType = "normal";
    }

    return "Sentence is " + sentenceType;
  }
  ```

  We added another check. Technically, the function works, but in terms of semantics there are problems.

  - Check for the presence of an exclamation mark occurs in any case, even if a question mark has already been detected.
  - The `else` branch is described for the second condition, but not for the first one.

  It would be more correct to use another possibility of conditional construction:

  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    getTypeOfSentence("Who?"); // => 'Sentence is question'
    getTypeOfSentence("No");   // => 'Sentence is normal'
    getTypeOfSentence("No!");  // => 'Sentence is exclamation'
  }

  static String getTypeOfSentence(String sentence)
  {
    var lastChar = sentence.charAt(sentence.length() - 1);
    var sentenceType = "";

    if (lastChar == '?') {
      sentenceType = "question";
    } else if (lastChar == '!') {
      sentenceType = "exclamation";
    } else {
      sentenceType = "normal";
    }

    return "Sentence is " + sentenceType;
  }
  ```

  Now all the conditions are built in a single structure. `else if` is «if the previous condition is not met, but the current condition is met.» It turns out this scheme:

  - if the last symbol is `?`, then `"question"`
  - otherwise, if the last symbol is `!`, then `"exclamation"`
  - otherwise `"normal"`

  Only one of the code blocks relating to the whole `if` construct will be executed.

  On the electronic map of Westeros, which Sam implemented, the Starks' allies are shown in a green circle, the enemies in red, and neutral families in gray.

  Write for Sam the function `whoIsThisHouseToStarks`, which accepts the family name as an input and returns one of three values:` `friend '`, `` enemy' `,` `neutral '`.

  Rules for determining:

    *Friends (`"friend"`): "Karstark", "Tally"
    * Enemies (`"enemy"'): "Lannister", "Frey"
    * Any other families are considered neutral.

  Call examples:

  ```java
  whoIsThisHouseToStarks("Karstark"); // => 'friend'
  whoIsThisHouseToStarks("Frey");     // => 'enemy'
  whoIsThisHouseToStarks("Joar");     // => 'neutral'
  whoIsThisHouseToStarks("Ivanov");   // => 'neutral'
  ```
